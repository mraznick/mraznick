  <!-- ABOUT ME SECTION -->

  <section class="about-me" id="about-me">
      <h2 class="section-title about-title">About Me</h2>
      <p class="section-subtitle about-subtitle">NYC-Based Career Salesman Gone Coder</p>

      <div class="about-body">
        <p>Born and raised in Omaha, Nebraska, I moved to New York City in August 2015 to pursue a career in film, media, and live music. 
          After some great projects over the course of 6 months, I decided the freelance life was not sustainable for me. As a result, I chose to go into tech sales for a steadier income.  </p>
        <p>Although I initially planned to work in sales short-term, I found a knack for it and worked my way up the ladder. 
          I eventually landed a Sales Director position at an emerging tech company, working larger deals with better income. But at that point, I realized I was burning out, and remembered I never really intended my career to be in sales. So I shifted back to a creative career path — This time, I wanted to pick up some new skills along the way.
        </p>
        <p>Today, I'm a graduate of the Software Engineering Immersive course with General Assembly NYC. I am a results-oriented Web Engineer and Developer who’s passionate about technology that serves a meaningful purpose in the world. After six years as a leader in tech sales, I’ve developed the work ethic and drive to bring culture and motivation to a team, as well as the curiosity to learn new things from my peers. I’m also more than willing to put my head down as an independent problem-solver, and able to handle fast-paced environments and tight deadlines with poise. I believe that with my skills in leadership and collaboration, coupled with my drive and work ethic to get the job done properly, I’ll be able to foster open communication and creative approaches to reach team goals in an organized manner. </p>
