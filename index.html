        NYC-Based Career Salesman Gone Coder
      </p>

      <div class="about-body">
        <p>
          Born and raised in Omaha, Nebraska, I moved to New York City in August
          2015 to pursue a career in film, media, and live music. After some
          great projects over the course of 6 months, I decided the freelance
          life was not sustainable for me. As a result, I chose to go into tech
          sales for a steadier income.
        </p>
        <p>
          Although I initially planned to work in sales short-term, I found a
          knack for it and worked my way up the ladder. I eventually landed a
          Sales Director position at an emerging tech company, working larger
          deals with better income. But at that point, I realized I was burning
          out, and remembered I never really intended my career to be in sales.
          So I shifted back to a creative career path — This time, I wanted to
          pick up some new skills along the way.
        </p>
        <p>
          Today, I'm a graduate of the Software Engineering Immersive course
          with General Assembly NYC. I am a results-oriented Web Engineer and
          Developer who’s passionate about technology that serves a meaningful
          purpose in the world. After six years as a leader in tech sales, I’ve
          developed the work ethic and drive to bring culture and motivation to
          a team, as well as the curiosity to learn new things from my peers.
          I’m also more than willing to put my head down as an independent
          problem-solver, and able to handle fast-paced environments and tight
          deadlines with poise. I believe that with my skills in leadership and
          collaboration, coupled with my drive and work ethic to get the job
          done properly, I’ll be able to foster open communication and creative
          approaches to reach team goals in an organized manner.

              As the frontend engineer, I was responsible for developing the frontend logic, including State management, site navigation/routing, and user profile creation. I also built user-friendly forms that 
              enabled visitors to post comments on the art pieces, which increased engagement and interactivity on the site. Through this project, I gained valuable experience in creating a compelling 
              user experience and developing functionality that enhances user engagement.</p>

                and took initiative to write a step-by-step plan of how our group should take on the entire back-end process with pair-programming. In regards to the app itself, I built our Views and Serializers, 
                allowing the front-end team to implement dictionaries for CRUD functionality (e.g. creating posts, comments, and user profiles). I also built the URLs to create
